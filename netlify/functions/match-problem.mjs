${problemNumbers ? `The image may contain multiple numbered problems. The student wants help specifically with problem(s): ${problemNumbers}. Focus ONLY on those problem numbers — look for them in the image (they will be labeled with numbers like "14." or "17)").` : `Look at the image and identify what type of math problem it is.`}

IMPORTANT DISTINCTION: If the problem shows (something + something)^n or (something − something)^n where n is a whole number, that is BINOMIAL EXPANSION (Chapters 9-10), NOT fractional exponents (Chapter 6). Chapter 6 is ONLY for when the exponent itself is a fraction like ½ or ¾.

Match to ALL relevant videos from this catalog. Many math concepts build on each other — for example, a problem might require finding the GCF first, then using it to simplify a fraction, so both GCF and simplification videos would be relevant. Similarly, some problems can be solved multiple ways (factoring, completing the square, quadratic formula), so all applicable method videos should be included.

Video catalog:
${videoCatalog}

IMPORTANT MATCHING RULES:
1. Treat EACH problem individually. Analyze what makes each one unique — don't lump them together. A "find the nth term" problem is NOT the same as "expand fully," even if both involve binomials raised to powers.
2. If a problem contains negative signs or subtraction (like (x−4)^6 vs (x+4)^6), the "with negatives" video variant is ALWAYS relevant because sign handling is a common mistake.
3. Always prefer the MOST SPECIFIC video over a general one. If a video exists for the exact sub-type (e.g., "finding nth term" vs general "expanding binomials"), the specific one should be "exact" and the general one should be "overview."

Categorize each matching video as one of these types:
- "exact" — this video teaches the EXACT problem type shown in the image (same structure, same technique needed)
- "overview" — this video covers a broader topic that includes this problem type, good for context
- "prerequisite" — the student should understand this concept first before tackling the problem
- "alternative" — a different method that could also solve this problem
- "variation" — this video covers a variation of the problem that handles a tricky aspect (like negative signs or coefficients)

${problemNumbers ? `The student specified multiple problems. You MUST group results by problem number. Use this JSON format:

{"problems": [{"problemNumber": "<the number from the image>", "matches": [{"number": <video 1-50>, "type": "exact"|"overview"|"prerequisite"|"alternative"|"variation", "reason": "<why>"}]}, ...], "explanation": "<what you see in the image>"}

Each problem gets its OWN matches array. Do NOT combine problems that need different techniques.` : `Respond in this JSON format:

{"problems": [{"problemNumber": "1", "matches": [{"number": <video 1-50>, "type": "exact"|"overview"|"prerequisite"|"alternative"|"variation", "reason": "<why>"}]}], "explanation": "<what you see in the image>"}`}

Include 1-5 matches per problem depending on how many are truly relevant. Don't pad with irrelevant videos. Always identify the most specific "exact" match possible. Keep reasons SHORT (under 15 words each). Output ONLY valid JSON, no other text.

If you truly cannot identify any math in the image, respond:
